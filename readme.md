## Usage Instructions
This is a travel kit web app with a mobile first design. It aims to provide users travel destinations quickly based on landmark popularity. The web app returns information such as city of interest, currency exchange rates for the period of time they wish to travel, and weather records based on historical data. Information is sourced from external APIs.

## Technologies Used
This front end elements of the web app runs on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The back end elements of the web app runs on Node Express. The server stores sensitive information such as private API keys, and make AJAX calls to the API to retrieve information to the browser.

## Approach to Solving the Problem
The important element of the this project is to identify the process flows, understand what is required and then map out the processes for fetching and returning information from external APIs. For example, to retrieve a particular source of information such as currency, the app may need to talk to multiple APIs. Having this planned and outlined in the beginning is important.

## Next Steps...
Play around more with CSS...
Include animated icons for weather results
Create database to store results instead of relying on API calls all the time
